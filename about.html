<p> I was born and raised in sunny south Florida surrounded by palm trees and my large family. In highschool I participated in the performance arts and competed in world class competitions for Winter Guard International. After highschool I worked at an animal clinic until ultimately deciding on a career in veterinary medicine. I moved from Florida to Colorado on my own to attend Bel-Rea's veterinary technology program and obtained an associates degree in veterinary technology, then became licensed to practice Vet med. When I'm not taking care of the animals at my job, I can be found taking care of my own four animals at home. I'm excited to start my new adventure in coding and software engineering! </p>
